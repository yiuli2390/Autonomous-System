# Introduction
The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is to find an efficient solution to deliver the goods to the shops in a shortest distance between 249 customers. The goods are delivery by the trucks start from the depot. On each route the truck has been assigned the same amount of 500 capacities for each routine to satisfy as much customers as it can without overlaps.

### Objective
The objective is to solve the vehicle routing problem to get the shortest distance between 249 customers and 1 depot travelling around by the trucks. Each truck is starting from the depot in the beginning and has 500 capacities on each routine and they cannot visit the same customer twice because it is inefficient repeating location.
